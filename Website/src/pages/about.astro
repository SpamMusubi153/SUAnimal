				<div class="content">
					<p>
						Greetings from A.n.I.Ma.L club! We're an enthusiastic bunch from Seattle University with 
						a thirst for knowledge about AI and ML technologies. But it's not just about algorithms 
						and codes; it's about ensuring these powerful tools are used for the greater good. Understanding the 
						sheer potential and the ethical considerations of AI is a massive responsibility, and we're up for the challenge. 
						We invite everyone - whether you're a student, faculty, or someone from the broader Seattle community, to join our endeavor.

						and offer hands-on learning experiences. We value collaborations and are always open to community-driven projects and ideas.
